               1. Difference between local storage and session storage ?
            </h4>
             <p>
                Ans:SessionStorage is similar to localStorage ; the difference is that while data in localStorage doesn't expire, data in sessionStorage is cleared when the page session ends. Whenever a document is loaded in a particular tab in the browser, a unique page session gets created and assigned to that particular tab

            </h4>
              <p>
                Ans:JavaScript variables have only two scopes. Global Variables  A global variable has a global scope which means it can be defined anywhere in your JavaScript code. Local Variables  A local variable will be visible only within a function where it is defined. Function parameters are always local to that function

               3. How to work event loop in javascript ?
            </h4>
              <p>
                Ans:The Event Loop has one simple job â€”  the Call Stack and the Callback Queue. If the Call Stack is empty, the Event Loop will take the first event from the queue and will push it to the Call Stack, which effectively runs it. Such an iteration is called a tick in the Event Loop.
